The Discord bot itself will run on a server or computer, not directly on your iPhone. However, you can control and use the bot on your iPhone by interacting with it through the Discord app. Here's how to set it up:

### Steps to Use the Bot on iPhone:
1. **Host the Bot:**
   - The bot needs to run on a server or hosting service (like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), [Replit](https://replit.com/), or [VPS providers](https://www.digitalocean.com/)).
   - Alternatively, you can run the bot on your computer, but the bot will only work while your computer is on and the bot script is running.

2. **Access the Bot Through Discord App:**
   - Once the bot is up and running, you can simply use the Discord app on your iPhone to interact with it as you would with any other bot or user. For example:
     - Type `!ban @user` to ban someone.
     - Type `!kick @user` to kick someone.
     - Type `!warn @user` to warn someone.
     - Type `!timeout @user 300` to timeout someone for 5 minutes.

3. **Ensure Permissions:**
   - Make sure the bot has the right permissions in your Discord server to use these commands. You can manage permissions in the Discord app on your iPhone:
     - Go to the server settings.
     - Navigate to "Roles" and ensure the bot's role has sufficient permissions (e.g., Ban Members, Kick Members, Moderate Members).

4. **Modify the Code for Mobile Compatibility (Optional):**
   - Although the bot commands work the same regardless of device, you can make commands more user-friendly for mobile users by simplifying them. For example:
     - Use shorter command names like `!b`, `!k`, `!w`, and `!t` instead of `!ban`, `!kick`, `!warn`, and `!timeout`.

   Update the command handling in the bot code:

   ```javascript
   if (command === 'b') { /* Ban logic */ }
   if (command === 'k') { /* Kick logic */ }
   if (command === 'w') { /* Warn logic */ }
   if (command === 't') { /* Timeout logic */ }
   ```

5. **Testing on iPhone:**
   - Log in to the Discord app on your iPhone.
   - Go to a server where the bot is active.
   - Test the bot by typing commands in the server's text channels.

### Hosting the Bot for Always-Online Access
If you want the bot to work 24/7 (so you can use it anytime from your iPhone), you need to host it on a cloud service. Here are some options:
- **Heroku**: Free and beginner-friendly, but has limitations (e.g., limited free hours).
- **Replit**: Allows you to run the bot directly in your browser and keep it online.
- **VPS (like DigitalOcean)**: Paid, but gives you full control over the server.
